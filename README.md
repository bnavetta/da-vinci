# Da Vinci

This project is designed to help creating data-based documents with Python and LaTeX. The build system is [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based, and
[PythonTeX](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) is used to integrate Python and LaTeX. A set of Python modules that integrate with the Gradle
build are available from PythonTeX.

## Codex

Codex is the Python component of Da Vinci (his notebooks are called Codex ...). The base module is named `da_vinci`.
